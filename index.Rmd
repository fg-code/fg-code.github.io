I am interested in research question at the intersection of nature conservation, agricultural production and livelihoods. Currently, I investigate the role of zero-deforestation commitments in the Brazilain soybean sector, using econometric modeling and large spatial and temporal data.  
More general, my work focuses on understanding causes and the spatio-temporal dynamics of land use changes, and most importantly, the loss of natural ecosystem as one of the major causes of global environmental change.   
  
I received my PhD from [Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin](https://www.geographie.hu-berlin.de/de) where I investigated spatio-temporal interaction of land use change (i.e.,soybean and cattle raching), environmental policies and tropical deforestation in Brazil. Following I was awarded a 2-year Postdoctoral-Fellowship at the [Socio-Environmnetal Synthesis Center (SESYNC)](https://www.sesync.org/). Currently, I am Postdoctoral Reaseracher at the [Department of Earth & Environment at Boston University](http://www.bu.edu/earth/), working in collaboration with the [Environmental Policy Lab (EPL) at ETH Zurich](https://epl.ethz.ch/).
